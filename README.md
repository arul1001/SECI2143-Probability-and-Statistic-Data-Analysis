# SECI2143-Probability and Statistic Data Analysis

### Course Summary:

<p align="justify"> This course is designed to introduce some statistical techniques as tools to analyse the
data. In the beginning the students will be exposed with various forms of data. The data
represented by the different types of variables are derived from different sources; daily
and industrial activities. The analysis begins with the data representation visually. The
course will also explore some methods of parameter estimation from different
distributions. Further data analysis is conducted by introducing the hypothesis testing.
Some models are employed to fit groups of data. At the end of course the students should
be able to apply some statistical models in analysing data using available software. </p>

### My Reflection for SECI2143 Probability and Statistic Data Analysis

<p align="justify"> This course introduced me to essential statistical techniques for analyzing real-world data, starting with types of data and visual representation, and progressing to parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. I learned how to apply both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis to uncover patterns and make informed conclusions.</p>

<p align="justify"> We completed two major projects that gave me practical experience. In Project 1, I conducted a real survey and used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. In Project 2, I applied inferential techniques such as hypothesis testing to draw deeper insights. Both projects required me to use R programming, which was a new but valuable tool for statistical analysis. Learning R was challenging at first, but it helped me understand how to process and interpret data more effectively using real coding.</p>

<p align="justify"> I found this course both interesting and challenging, and it has strengthened my analytical thinking while giving me hands-on experience with statistical tools used in professional data analysis.</p>
